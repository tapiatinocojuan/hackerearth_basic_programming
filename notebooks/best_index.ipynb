    "# Best Index\n",

    "You are given an array $A$ of $N$ elements. Now you need to choose the best index of this array $A$. An index of the array is called best if the special sum of this index is maximum across the special sum of all the other indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the special sum for any index $i$, you pick the first element that is $A[i]$ and add it to your sum. Now you pick next two elements i.e. $A[i+1]$ and $A[i+2]$ and add both of them to your sum. Now you will pick the next $3$ elements and this continues till the index for which it is possible to pick the elements. For example:\n",

    "This problem has a tricky solution, I tried to solved it by brute force but the amount of operations (sums) was huge and caused the solution failed by exceding the time limit. The second thing I tried was find a method to reduce the number of sums to calculate a especial sum. I read the array $A$ but I created a second arrray called **sums**, the first element of sum is always $0$, after that number the next are calculated with the next formula $$sums[i] = sums[i-1] + A[i-1]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We can calculate sums of sub parts of the array A in a simple way. For example, to calculate the sum of all the elements in the $A$ array, instead of doing $A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4]$ we just get the first and the last indixes, thats it, fist_index = $0$ and last_index = $4$ and do the next operation $sums[last\\_index + 1] - sums[first\\_index]$.\n",

The max amount of numbers used for the calculation is get when the index is $0$, this accours because with index $0$ we have the bigest amount of availible numbers. Once we move to the nex item the amount of availble numbers is going to decrese by 1 number. the amount of numbers used in the summation is obtined with a very well know equation $$num\\_elements = \\sum_{i=0}^ni=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ we can obtain the number n for every index $first\\_index$ as \n",
