# hackerearth_basic_programming
This repo includes all my solved exercises from hackerearth basic programming.

## About me
My name is Juan Tapia and I'm from Mexico. I am electrical engineer, but the past two years I have been working with python a lot. I love coding and I would like to improve my skills, so I decided to create this repo I think this could be a good way other person could help me to achive my goal. **Please feel free to make any comment or suggestion!**

I have been registered to hackerarth since 2019, but I used it just for some months and then I leaved. Now, I would like to start using the web page again. I'm going to make a jupyter notebook for every exercice I solve from hackereart.    

This is the first time I made a project completely in English, so sorry for all my grammar and spelling mistakes.
